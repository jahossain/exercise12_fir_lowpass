## Explanation
When the filter order **M** increases from 20 to 64, the **transition band** between the passband and stopband becomes much **narrower**, resulting in a sharper cutoff.  
The **impulse response** also becomes **longer**, because a higher-order FIR filter requires more coefficients to achieve the desired frequency characteristics.  
As M increases, the filterâ€™s approximation of the ideal low-pass shape improves, producing a **smoother** and **sharper** frequency response with reduced leakage between bands.  
However, the higher order also means **greater computational cost** and **longer delay**, since the filter length directly affects the number of multiplications per output sample.
